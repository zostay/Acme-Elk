Acme::Elk - it isn't Moose

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  package MyObject;
  use Acme::Elk;

  has foo => (
      is => 'rw',
      isa => 'Str',
  );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

In case you know someone with hang-ups about using L<Moose>, you can use
L<Acme::Elk>. It is exactly the same as Moose, but named Acme::Elk.

And it's already 1.000!
